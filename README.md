## Project Quickstart Ideas
The beauty of OpenShift is that you can deploy any type of application, which allows you to get creative based on your interests. To get you started on this GHC Hackathon, we've come up
with a couple ideas that may inspire you to think of your own!

**Collecting Events Data**
Use the Python seed to collect relavant data surrounding galas and fundraisers for important causes in your area.

**Daily Action Items Application**
Use our Java seed to connect to the Google Mail API so you can send emails to subscribed users on daily action items for the humanitarian cause of your choice (ie sustainability, womens rights)

**Develop a simple Website that updates automatically**
Use our Rails seed to create a simple website for any humanitarian cause of your choice. (Information automatically updates using webhooks).

**Create a Blog**
Use our WordPress seed to start a blog or blogs!
