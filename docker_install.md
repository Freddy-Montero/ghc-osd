# About Docker CE
Docker Community Edition (CE) is ideal for developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.

Docker CE has three types of update channels, stable, test, and nightly:
* Stable gives you latest releases for general availability.
* Test gives pre-releases that are ready for testing before general availability.
* Nightly gives you latest builds of work in progress for the next major release.

For GraceHopper we care about the **Stable** release
